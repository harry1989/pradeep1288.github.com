I did my computer science and engineering from [PES Institute of Technology](http://www.pes.edu), Bangalore. I worked for  D E Shaw & Co for two years. Currently I'm pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at University of Southern California, Los Angeles. My favourite editor is Vim and my favourite programming language is C. I know some python, perl, html, css, javascript and off late some C#. I use a MacBook Pro for most of my work. I also own a [Bose IE2](http://www.boseindia.com/retail/bose-product-detail.aspx?Prd_Id=111&Cat_Id=647) and use it with my Mac to listen to music. I listen to pretty much everything except heavy metal.
