As you all know that I recently bought a Kindle Fire and you see my review [here](). As you may all know, the Kindle Fire is locked to the Amazon App store and it is available only in the US. I initially thought that I would not root my Kindle my install the apk's from third party site instead. But inturn that process turned out to be a little painful. A few friends of mine on twitter, [@varunkumar](http://twitter.com/varunkumar) and [@vivekgolecha](http:twitter.com/vivekgolecha) suggested me to root the device and install Android Market. The only challenge was that I had a Macbook and its not a easy procees from a Mac. After a lot of research online, I found an awesome tool which can root your Kindle in no less than five minutes.

## Steps to Root Your Kindle Fire running 6.2.2 firmware

* Before you begin, goto Settings->More->Device and turn on "Allow Installation Of Applications"
* Now download the following three tools on your Mac: 
   
   * The [Kindle Water](http://goo.gl/qIOFq) app which you would be running to root your Kindle Fire.
   * [ADB Fixer](http://www.box.com/s/qnnqnr2k20e9y31shu5x) app.
   * TWRP Recovery tool. You can download it from [here](http://goo.gl/d1vbH). Once downloaded, put the file on your   Desktop and rename it to recovery.img

Now connect your Kindle to your Mac, using a Micro USB cable. 

* Double click the KindleWater_2.1.dmg file, and open KindleWater from it. 

* Click on Set up **ADB button** first, and after that is done click on **Root** button. Don't worry, the software will automatically guide you what to do next. During this process your Kindle will reboot a couple of times. Don't panice and at any given point of time don't plug your Kindle from your Mac. If you do not encounter any errors, then you should see the **Super User** app installed on your Kindle. If you encounter any errors see step 5 else goto step 6

* If you encounter errors from step 5, run the ADB Fixer app you downloaded in step 2 on your Mac and redo Step 4. 

* Press **Disconnect** on your Kindle Fire and then unplug it from your Mac.

Congratulations :) You have now rooted your kindle fire!
